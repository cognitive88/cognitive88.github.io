## Hey there, I'm Leo from South Korea.  
The name *Scieneer* comes from combining science and engineering â€” two areas Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working with.

I studied computer engineering, then went deeper into cutting-edge computing and computer architecture during grad school.  
Here's the stuff Iâ€™ve been messing with:

* DRAM Microarchitecture (DDR, HBM, LPDDR, etc.)  
* Processing-in-Memory for AI acceleration  
* NPU design and AI optimization  

Right now, I'm figuring out what I should build for the next AI era.  
Looking ahead, I believe Korea needs more companies that can grow their strengths on both sides â€” AI and hardware â€” working in harmony, competing globally, not just following. And not just for AI â€” but for robotics, quantum computing, VR, and everything else that defines our future.

At the end of the day, I believe itâ€™s mission, technology, and the desire to build a better civilization that will make it happen.
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been exploring Tenstorrent chips and keeping up with AI trends, thinking about how we can build better systems with them.

Shoot me an email anytime, if youâ€™ve got questions or wanna know more.  
I always enjoy talking, about anything.  
If you're interested in what I do, or maybe thinking about working together, letâ€™s talk.
